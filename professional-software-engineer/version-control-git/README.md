# Version Control

## Version control is a MUST in software development.

### Here are some commonly used tools in the industry:

## \[Version Control System\]

### 1\) [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

_Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency._

In more simple words, you can think of Git as a snapshotting tool to save different snapshots of your code at different time points, so that you can trace different versions of your code and make branches out of them when necessary.



## \[Cloud places to hold your codebase\]

### 2\) [GitHub](https://github.com/)

### 3\) [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

Both of them have free plans and paid plans. They provide similar functions so either one is suitable for both personal and commercial usage. 

However, according to my observations: 

**GitHub** is more commonly used for personal portfolio or open-source projects, maybe because of its social-media-like UI. 

**Bitbucket** is more commonly used for big commercial projects. It might because its pull-request user experience\(UX\) is more user-friendly. Also, it is under [**Atlassian**](https://www.atlassian.com/), a conglomerate broad brand that owns a lot of software development tools like Jira, Trello, and SourceTree. Development teams like using them together as a whole set of tools.



## \[Git GUI\]

Git GUI makes working with Git easier. If you are not using it, you have to use the terminal \(or Vim ? LOL\)

### 4\) [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) \(personally prefer because of its neater UI\)

### 5\) [Git GUI](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)



## \[Personal preference\]

#### Git 

#### + GitHub \(if it is a small or personal project\) / BitBucket \(if it is a big commercial project\)

#### + SourceTree \(Note: I use Mac Book Pro. Not sure if it is still prettier in other Operation Systems\)
