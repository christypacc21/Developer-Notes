# Testing Techniques Overview

Testings are for ensuring software quality, which means checking if the product is doing the right things and doing the things right. It can be a super broad field. In a large project, a whole team of Quality Assurance Engineers \("QA"s in short\)\(sometimes the QA team size can be big and close to the developer team size\) could be included to align with software developers to safeguard software quality. 

The testing techniques adopted in the QAs' field are quite different from those in the developers' field. QAs and developers usually have different separations of concern. From my experiences, developers focus more on their codebase, while QAs focus on the software as a whole.

This article is mainly for developers and will focus on the techniques and professional conduct that we, developers, should know to ensure software quality.

## \[Common Testing Categories\]

### Unit Test 

The smallest unit in testing. Test a single unit of code. Especially useful for testing dump components  \(often a pure function\).

### Integration Test

A bigger picture than unit tests. It connects components to see how they work together or to test the connections between different units of code, in order to see if a function is doing the things right and doing the right things as a whole. 

It usually needs more advanced skills like mocking, spying, and stubbing.

### Automation Test

Test the entire process of your UI. It is typically either done through automated scripts and tools or hire human testers to do them manually. 

Related concepts involve black box testing vs white box testings, etc.
