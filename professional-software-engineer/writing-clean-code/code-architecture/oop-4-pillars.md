# OOP 4 Pillars

#### If you use scripting languages like Python and JavaScript, instead of OOP languages like Java and C++, the concepts may be quite abstract for you to understand deeply. It is fine, just try to understand the broad view first.

## \[OOP 4 Pillars\] 

#### 1\) Encapsulation

"Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state **private**, inside a class. Other objects don’t have direct access to this state. Instead, they can only call a list of public functions — called methods."

#### 2\) Abstraction

"\(A natural extension of encapsulation\). Each object should **only** expose a high-level mechanism for using it. This mechanism should hide the internal implementation details. It should only reveal operations relevant to the other objects."

#### 3\) Inheritance

"Reuse the common logic and extract the unique logic into a separate class. Create a \(child\) class by deriving from another \(parent\) class. The child class reuses all fields and methods of the parent class \(common part\) and can implement its own \(unique part\)."

* Note that in many cases, "Composition" is a much better choice than "Inheritance", to achieve loose coupling and make components more reusable. \("Composition" is out of the current article's scope, we will open a section to discuss the variety of relationships in OOD in the future.\)

#### 4\) Polymorphism

"Defining a \(parent\) interface to be reused. It outlines a bunch of common methods. Then, each child class implements its own version of these methods."
