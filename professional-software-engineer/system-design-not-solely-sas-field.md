# System Design

System Design should not only be Solution Architects' scope of concern. Knowing how the system works as a whole let you make better decisions and grow to a higher

How to design high-quality systems that can really solve business problems and face future challenges?

It is a big data era. Hardware has its own limits. How do we can we leverage distributed architecture to handle the big data while ensuring the system's performance and scalability?

The ability to think in the bigger picture can let you go further, even if you are still a junior developer. What if, one day you want to become a solution architect? 

I personally put a certain amount of effort into learning system design. Not only because it is a common topic in tech interviews, but also because I found clean and elegant architectures beautiful and full of wisdom. Philosophically speaking, our life is also full of architectures. I am a super tidy person, I love applying architecture philosophy in daily life to make it organized and simpler.
