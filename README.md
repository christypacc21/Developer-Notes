# Introduction

I am a 1997 girl. I have been working as a full-time software engineer for around two years.

It has been an unbelievably amazing journey. 💻 ❤️ 🐫

So I am taking some notes to organize and spread the knowledge and experiences to anyone in need, also as a record for my own study reference.

if you spot any mistakes, please feel free to correct me by messages or pull requests \(I will add you as a contributor\) Cheers! :\) 

\(The Blog is still under construction, I will keep filling the holes\)
