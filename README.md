# Introduction

Blog Link : [https://christypacc21.gitbook.io/developer-notes/](https://christypacc21.gitbook.io/developer-notes/)

I am a 1997 girl. I entered the IT industry without a CS degree 🎓 and have been working as a software engineer for around two years.

It has been an unbelievably amazing journey. 💻 ❤️ 🐫

So I am taking some notes to spread the knowledge and experiences to anyone in need.

Since I am also still learning, please feel free to correct me \(by messages or pull requests\) if you spot any mistakes:\) Cheers!

\(The Blog is still under construction, I will keep filling the holes\)
