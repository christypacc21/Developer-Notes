# Relational database - SQL

**SQL is a Structured Query Language**. Pronounced either "ess-cue-el" or "se-quel". 

SQL is **used to communicate with a relational database management system** \("RDBMS" in short\) for managing data stored in the databases \(for example, MySQL or PostgresSQL\). It is widely used in **software development** \(often serves as a data CRUD assistant in RESTful APIs\) and **data analysis**.

Although there are a lot of books and videos SQL tutorials out there, the best way to learn SQL is by **practicing with your own hands**. Even if you have not yet encountered any SQL usage in your projects, it is still worth learning because SQL will open a lot of doors for you. 



### I personally learned SQL by playing with these two popular resources:

### Making your own notes is a good way to strengthen your knowledge so that you know how to use them when needed. Here is a SQL mindmap I built while learning SQL, as an example :

### While you are working with SQL in projects, you may need a SQL cheat sheet that you can find the SQL syntax quickly. Here is an example.

### Note that SQL syntax can be slightly different \(just slightly\) in different RDMBS \(usually for RDBMS-specific commands like "create table"\). If one day you meet some weird bugs after entering the "correct" SQL syntax in a specific RDBMS, it can possibly be the cause.
