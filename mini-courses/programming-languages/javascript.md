# JavaScript

## \[JavaScript is commonly used for\]

#### Front-end development

Main-stream modern browsers can understand JavaScript. JavaScript is often embedded into HTML files to add interactive effects to the webpage components \(e.g hide a button after clicking, submit a form's data to the server using AJAX, trigger a pop-up alert to users, timer, etc\). Sometimes it is used with JQuery\(a popular JS library written in JavaScript\) to speed up front-end development. 

Apart from using vanilla JavaScript, a developer can also use popular front-end frameworks or libraries like React, React Native \(building mobile apps\), Angular, Vue, etc, to build a fancy interactive frontend to achieve a better user experience.



#### Server-side development in Node.js \(an out-of-browser JS runtime environment\)

After Node.js was born \(a runtime environment that uses the V8 engine, making JavaScript runnable outside the browser\), JavaScript can be used to write server-side logic like building RESTful APIs, authentication, communicate with a database doing CRUD tasks, read and write files in the computer, perform I/O actions using Socket.io, etc\).

**=&gt;** Since JavaScript can write both front-end and back-end logic, it is actually a full-stack development language. A programmer can write a full-stack app by knowing only JavaScript. Also, JavaScript is relatively easier to pick up and write\(less verbose\) than most languages like Java and C++. That makes JS very popular nowadays and JS is broadly adopted by projects that need to move fast.



## \[How JS works and JS's iconic characteristics\]

A **weak** and **dynamic** language. \(TypeScript is a compiled language based on JavaScript syntax and provides strong-typing\).

Environment \(Google V8 engine\) - **Inside browsers\(e.g Chrome\) and outside browsers\(Node.js\)**

**Single-threaded** but **non-blocking** \(which means can do asynchronous tasks\) in Node.js .  Due to this characteristic, Node.js is suitable for handling I/O intensive tasks like web socket for instant messaging\(using socket.io\), while less suitable for doing CPU intensive tasks \(multi-threaded tools like Java SpringBoot could handle this better instead\). \(The concept about threading is related to the CS topic "Computer System", which is out of the current article's scope\).

The JavaScript **Event Loop** makes non-blocking in a single-threaded environment possible.
