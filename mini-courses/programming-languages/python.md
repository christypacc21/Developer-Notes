# Python

## \[Notes\]

Beware there are two main versions of Python - Python2 and Python3. 

Python2 is the older version of Python while Python3 is the newest at the moment. 

Their syntax is similar but **if you don't have a specific reason to use Python2** \(eg to maintain legacy code\), **learning Python3 directly is recommended**. Python2 is old and going to be deprecated now. Many frameworks and tools no longer support Python2. In the future, Python code will all eventually be upgraded to or be directly written in Python3.

## \[Python is commonly used for\]

### Scripting & Automation

## \[How Python works and Python's iconic characteristics\]

\(under construction\)

Language analysis 

* Strong
* Dynamic

Primitive Datatypes

* integer \(represent whole numbers from negative infinity to infinity\)
* float \(rational numbers that usually end with a decimal figure\)
* boolean \(either True or False\)
* string \(stores data that involves characters, denoted by single or double quotes, eg "ha"\)

Non-primitive Datatypes

* Lists \(similar to "array" \[ \]  in JavaScript\)
* Dictionaries \(similar to "object" { } in JavaScript\)
* Tuples \(immutable Lists\)
* Sets \(Dictionaries that only allow unique items\)
* Files
