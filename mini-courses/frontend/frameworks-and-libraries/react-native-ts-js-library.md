# React Native \(TS / JS Library\)

2020-10-3

I have experience of using React Native to develop a commercial application \(did not use it with Expo because I found using Expo would lead to some weird UI problems at that time\). It is quite handy and easy to pick up if you already know React and JavaScript \(or TypeScript\). It can be used with an application state management library \(eg Redux\).

**\[Suitable for\]** 

_React Native can be used for making platform-typed apps like an online book store._ 

The advantage is that you can develop an application that can be published to the app store without learning native\(eg IOS or Android\) app development skills. If you are a React developer knowing Javascript or TypeScript, you can basically pick it up in a short time. React Native is usually used and especially efficient for \(eg start-ups\) making POCs\(proof of concepts\) or MVP products to publish quickly with a small development team, for the market testing.

**\[Not suitable for\]** 

_But note that React Native is less preferred for making apps that rely heavily on native functions like video players \(eg a video streaming app\)._ 

It is because React Native is relatively new \(initial release in 2015, which is very much younger than native platforms like IOS and Android, implying a smaller developer community\) and not yet officially released by Facebook \(current version is still 0.XX instead of 1\). Sometimes there will be weird bugs that you may need to count on the community \(even yourself\) to solve.
