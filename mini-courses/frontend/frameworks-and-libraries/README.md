# Frameworks & Libraries

Frameworks and Libraries speed up application development. You don't need to code the utilities from scratch \(eg configuring a web server from scratch\) \(we say it "reinventing the wheel"\), the frameworks or libraries has already provided you with those wheels for you to use them directly.
