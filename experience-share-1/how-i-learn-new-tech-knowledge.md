# How I learn new Tech knowledge

### At different stages, different \(combinations of\) methods are adopted. 

#### **Stage 1\) Starts from introductory resources**

When I am approaching a new field of knowledge, starting from an introductory video or article is a smart way to get a broad view of the knowledge efficiently. 

#### **Stage 2\) DIY - Learn by doing \| Write some code**

After grabbing a broad view of how the thing works, I will start getting my hands dirty to play with it in experiments. Try to follow the tutorials to make toy apps or POCs \(Proof of Concepts\).

#### **Stage 3\) Refer to classics**

Later when I have more knowledge storage, I will start depending on more classical and comprehensive first-hand resources. 

For example, famous university courses \(eg Algorithms by Princeton University\), classical books in the industry \(eg "Fluent Python" and "You don't know JavaScript"\), a framework's official documentation \(only if it is a well-written one\) \(eg Django's Documentation\), and authoritative academics papers \(eg "The Google File System"\). Their contents are generally systematically organized and double-checked before they can be published. Their authoritativeness is also a sign of their information's reliability. 

Of course, some of them are more advanced so I cannot understand them at first glance. Then I may refer to summaries first, or start with a more beginner-facing one instead before drilling deep into them. But yeah, you know what I mean - the spirit of referring to CLASSICS.

#### **All stage - Take notes and output**

Along the study journey, I like making notes to organize and record what I have learned.
