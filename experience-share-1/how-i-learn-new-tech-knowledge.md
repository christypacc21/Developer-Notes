# How I learn new Tech knowledge

At different stages, different \(combinations of\) methods are adopted. Along the study journey, I like making notes to organize and record what I have learned.

When I am approaching a new field of knowledge, starting from an introductory video or article is a smart way to get a broad view of the knowledge efficiently. 

After grabbing a broad view of how the thing works, I will start getting my hands dirty to play with it in experiments. 

Later when I have more knowledge storage, I will start depending on more classical, comprehensive, and systematically organized \(and first-hand raw\) resources like famous university courses or classical books in the industry. Their contents are generally systematically organized and double-checked before it can be published. 

\[will add more content...\]
